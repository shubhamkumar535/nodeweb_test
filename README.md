## The Challenge

Build a REST API that will allow Polycade to manage pricing individually on machines remotely with the following:

- Endpoints
  - GET `/pricing-models`
    - returns all of the pricing models available for the system
    - also returns the default pricing model in `prices.json`
  - POST `/pricing-models`
    - creates a new pricing model in the system
    - returns the ID of the new pricing model to the caller
  - GET `/pricing-models/:pm-id`
    - get an individual pricing model
    - include the price configurations for the pricing model
    - if the pricing model isn't found by `pm-id` it responds with not found
  - PUT `/pricing-models/:pm-id`
    - updates an existing pricing model meta-data
    - does not affect the pricing configurations for the pricing model
  - GET `/pricing-models/:pm-id/prices`
    - returns the prices configured for a specific pricing model
  - POST `/pricing-models/:pm-id/prices`
    - adds a new price configuration for a pricing model
  - DELETE `/pricing-models/:pm-id/prices/:price-id`
    - removes a price configuration from a pricing model
    - if the pricing model isn't found by `pm-id` it responds with not found
    - if the price configuration isn't found by `price-id` it responds with not found
  - PUT `/machines/:machine-id/prices/:pm-id`
    - sets the pricing model for an individual machine to the one from `pm-id`
    - if the machine already has a pricing model, it is replaced by this one
    - if the machine isn't found by `machine-id` it responds with not found
    - if the pricing model isn't found by `pm-id` it responds with not found
  - DELETE `/machines/:machine-id/prices/:pm-id`
    - removes the pricing model from the machine (unsets it)
  - GET `/machines/:machine-id/prices`
    - return the pricing model and price configurations set for a given machine
    - if the machine does not have a pricing model configured then the default model from `prices.json` is returned
    - if the machine isn't found by `machine-id` it responds with not found
- Tests
  - Each endpoint should have its own test
- Database
  - Use PostgreSQL to store data about machines and prices
